            deeply value and appreciate every form of involvement.

            simply visiting our exhibits, your support is invaluable to our
            mission of making science accessible and engaging for everyone.
            We're also committed to giving back to the community and are always
            happy to explore opportunities for collaboration and assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have an idea for a partnership, a project, or simply need
            some help bringing your science-related vision to life, please don't
            hesitate to reach out – we're more than happy to lend a hand and
            work together to inspire the next generation of scientists and

            <p>
              There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are
              very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and
              accessible to the whole community. 
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also support us by donating items of interest to the
              museum’s collections. If you have some item or collection that you
              think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our
              Collections Department and they will be able to assist you.

            <h3>Internship</h3>
            <p>
              Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun
              and excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with people?
            </p>
            <p>
              Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at
              the museum.
            </p>
            <p>
              You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people
              who are passionate about science and sharing it with the wider
              community.

          <div class="volunteer">
            <h3>Volunteer</h3>
            <p>
              A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
              displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
              scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
              monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
              discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
              contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get
              involved.
