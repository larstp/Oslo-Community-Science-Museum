## Assignment

This is a repo for the first year Semester Project from NOROFF Frontend Development FED1, October Class OCT24.

In this assignment we are to design and program a webpage for a ficticious Community Science Museum, with a focus on teaching kids science.

The project is to show that we understand branding, target audience, hierarchy, semantic code, DRY principle, image optimixation and everything else we have learned so far this semester.

### Figma

Here's the Figma protptype for the mobile version:

Here's the Figma prototype for the desktop vesion:

Here's the Figma prototype for the high fidelity wireframes (includes both desktop and mobile versions. (A bit fiddly due to time constraints):

Page layout:
- Home (index.html)
- Explore (explore.html)
  - Explore: For Kids (explore-kids.html)
  - Explore: For Teachers (explore-teachers.html)
  - Explore: For Researchers (explore-researchers.html)
 - Spaces (spaces.html)
 - Events (events.html)
 - Visit (visit.html)
 - Get Involved (get-involved.html)
 - Contact+Buy Tickets (contact.html)

In addition I have added a placeholder site for the empty links that would lead to something else if this was a proper webpage. (placeholder.html)
