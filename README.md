## Assignment

This is a repo for the first year Semester Project from NOROFF Frontend Development FED1, October Class OCT24.

In this assignment we are to design and program a webpage for a ficticious Community Science Museum, with a focus on teaching kids science.

The project is to show that we understand branding, target audience, hierarchy, semantic code, DRY principle, image optimixation and everything else we have learned so far this semester.
