            <h3>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h3>
            <p>
              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the
              “Energetica” exhibition is coming to the Oslo Community Science
              Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to
              experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From
              solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how
              turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.
